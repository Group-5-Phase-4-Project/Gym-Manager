## Introduction



## Setup

Some starter code in place for Rails API backend and React frontend to set up, run:

```Terminal
$ bundle install
$ rails db:migrate db:seed
$ npm install --prefix client
```

It will also be helpful to see what's happening during the request/response cycle by running the
app in the browser. You can run the Rails server with:

```Terminal
$ rails s
```

And you can run React in another terminal with:

```console
$ npm start --prefix client
```
